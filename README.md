# Project Overwiew

This project is a Basic Network Sniffer created using Python and the Scapy library. It was built as part of my cybersecurity internship to demonstrate the ability to monitor and analyze live network traffic. Through this tool, I gained practical knowledge of how data flows in a network and how packets are structured, which is crucial for roles like Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst or Network Security Professional.

# Objective

- The main aim of this project is to:

- Understand how network packets are structured.

- Learn how to capture and analyze real-time data packets.

- Create a tool that monitors IP traffic and identifies TCP packets with port numbers.

- Strengthen core networking and Python skills relevant to cybersecurity.

# What I Learned

- Basics of packet sniffing using Scapy.

- Difference between IP, TCP, and other protocols.

- How to inspect live data flow across a network interface.

- Importance of analyzing ports and packet types in cybersecurity.
